## Making a lookup list of vim commands
- **g commands**
  - `gq` format a line into a readable format, more like wrapping
    - `gq5j` format the 5 lines down, ie, wrap it
  - `g$` or `g0` jump to end or beginning of visual line instead of absolute
    - The absolute commands are just `$` and `0`
  - `gu` uncapitalize and `gU` is capitalize
    - `gU3w` capitalize 3 words
  - `f<x>` would be find the next instance of `<x>`
  - `gf` go to a file
  - `gv` go to last selection in visual mode
- `qa` to begin recording macros
  - `@a` to run the macro `a`
